# Platforming game.
game is coded inside the canvas. i coded in a slicer for sprite animation, a short algorithm for AI behaviour and for the placement of the plataforms and of the treasure. also made a solution for the gravity and jump mechanics as well as collisions. and some other stuff.
Created this little game in ACiN bootcamp within 4 days. its purely coded in Javascript without any libraries or frameworks. the logic behind it
is pretty simple and the code is poorly optimized. This was a very quick learning project without any intentions of actually selling it.
Feel free to go through it and drop any advice or improvements. I'd apreciate it.
Obrigado!
