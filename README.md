# BootCamp
Created this litle game in ACiN bootcamp within 4 days. its purely coded in Javascript without any libraries or frameworks. the logic behind it
is pretty simple and the code is poorly optimized. This was a very quick learning project without any intentions of actually selling it.
Feel free to go through it and drop me any corrections if you want. I'd apreciate it.
Obrigado!
